Contributions are welcome - please test all contributions on a local version of the Sentry server.

Please run the server locally and test changes to the plugin against that instance of the Sentry server. The server source
can be cloned from:
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry

The Sentry team has provided a nice guide to getting the server running on a local dev environment:
https://docs.sentry.io/internal/environment/

Thanks!
